# Investment Calculator
### About
This is a complex investment calculator written in Java.
You can input various starting amounts, variable schedules of contributions,
and variable schedules of rates of return. There are multiple
ways to view the investment, including a year by year option
and more simple options. This calculator is complex in that it
allows the user to input changing contributions over different
lengths of time, as well as different rates of return over a separate
set of time periods. Project still in progress as of August 2022.

### Purpose
The goal of this project was to practice my object-oriented design skills in Java, 
as well as to practice my Git skills. You will notice that the code
structure is heavily object-oriented and includes separate classes
for most procedures. This was also the first project I
created using Git in my IDE terminal, allowing me to
practice using commits, staging, branches, merges, etc.. This
code also implements some (although very minimal) functional
programming design processes, including the Java Streams API. This
was done intentionally to practice techniques taught in a recent
functional programming course.
